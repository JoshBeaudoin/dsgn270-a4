*For the second half of this project we had to make three pages that are pages that you would see when you clicked on them. I have gone with Gamestop again as it was the easiest one to base it off of
*For the first one i did the Playstation 5 page, when you click the tab it brings you to a page that looks somewhat like this with all o fthe exlusvive PS5 games and console content.
*For the second one i did the Login Menu, when clicked on it brings you to where you put email and password with also forgot password tab.
* For the third one i did the "More" Menu, when clicked on it brings you to a page with more options such as older generation consoles like Xbox 360 and PS3
